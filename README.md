# YTPPlus-Bot
 A simple and poorly coded YTP+ discord bot. Created in honor of my old friend Gary21115.

## Requirements
- [x] FFMpeg & FFProbe in PATH
- [x] ImageMagick in PATH
- [x] Node.js
- [x] Knowledge of making Discord Bots

## Instructions

To install, open terminal in this folder, and type `npm install`.

The prefix is b! by default. It can be changed in index.js.
Make sure you know what you're doing, and make sure you also know how you make the config.

If you've finished with the config, Download the [zip archive of the original YTP+ repo](https://github.com/hellfire3d/YTPPlus) for YTP+, and place the sounds, musics, resources and sources in the lib folder.

Personally, i would recommend using the YTP+ pack Gary21115 made. [Download here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3vkcrinzd8zq8kn/AACDyQqAbU8EpOQX6uzYhI3xa?dl=1)

Now, you should be able to run this bot with no issues. To run it, type `node index.js` in terminal.
